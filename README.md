# Text-to-speech-program
The provided Python program is an implementation of a simple voice assistant called "Jarvis." This voice assistant can listen to voice commands from the user, recognize them, and respond accordingly. The program utilizes various libraries, including pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, speech_recognition for speech recognition, and the win32com module for handling exceptions. The voice assistant can respond to a user's greeting by saying "Hi!"

the following libraries has been imported:
pyttsx3: A text-to-speech conversion library for generating voice output.
speech_recognition (as sr): A library for recognizing and processing speech input.
win32com.server: A module used for handling exceptions.

The provided Python program demonstrates a basic implementation of a voice assistant named "Jarvis." It utilizes the pyttsx3 and speech_recognition libraries to convert text to speech and recognize spoken words, respectively. While the current functionality is limited to responding with a greeting when the keyword 'jarvis' is detected, it can be extended to perform more advanced tasks and respond to a wider range of voice commands.
